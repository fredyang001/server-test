# server-test
1. Can it see me?
2. Does it like me?
3.  Try an update!
4. How about the new subdomain?
5. How about that deployment testing?
6. let's check the date/time stamp, and again, and again, maybe fourth time lucky; fifth time will be the charm
Perhaps #6?
Finally got it right
Maybe one last test
